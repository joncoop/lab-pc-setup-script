# PC Lab Setup Script

This is a script I wrote to automate the task of setting up computers in school my computer lab. I got tired of going to each computer and manually installing each application one at a time at each computer.

## What it does

First, it downloads and installs the following applications:

- Color Cop 
- Python 3.11.3
- Bluej 5.10
- Google Drive for Desktop

Then it installs the following Python packages:
- beautifulsoup4
- matplotlib
- nympy
- pygame
- pyinstaller 
- python-docx 
- requests"

Next, all student user profiles that have not been used in the past year are deleted.

Finally, it hides desktop icons for applications that will not be used in my classes and puts applications on the desktop for applications that we do use regularly.

## How to use

Download the script to the computer to set up. Then right-click on the script and select "Run as administrator".

## Fun fact

I know very little about batch scripting. This was almost entirely written by ChatGTP. We worked on little parts of this script at a time. I put everything together into one unified script.
